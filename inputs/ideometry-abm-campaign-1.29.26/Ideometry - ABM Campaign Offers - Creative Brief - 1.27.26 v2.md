## **Why These Lead Magnets?**

### **Strategic Rationale**

| Factor | Competitive Intelligence | Demand Gen Analyzer |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Funnel Stage** | Problem-aware (know they have competitors, unsure how they compare) | Solution-aware (know they need demand gen, unsure which channels) |
| **Emotion** | Curiosity \+ anxiety (FOMO about competitor moves) | Frustration \+ hope (tired of wasting budget) |
| **Sales Conversation** | "Let's talk about how to act on these insights" | "Let's build the program we just scoped" |
| **Qualification Signal** | Has competitors \= real market \= viable prospect | Has budget \= ready to invest \= viable prospect |

### 

### **Why Not Gated PDFs or Webinars?**

1. **Interactive tools create higher engagement** — Users invest time answering questions, increasing commitment  
2. **Personalized output is more valuable** — Generic content is everywhere; custom analysis is rare  
3. **Demonstrates capability** — The tool IS the proof that Ideometry understands their world  
4. **Better lead quality** — Someone who completes a 5-minute tool is more qualified than a PDF download  
5. **Conversation starter** — "I saw your report — let's discuss" is an easy sales hook

   ## **Pain Point Ads**

   ### **Variation 1: Lost deal frustration — the painful moment when marketing can't explain why they lost**

   **Target Role:** VP of Marketing at robotics companies

   #### Post Text (above image)

Your robotics company lost 3 enterprise deals last quarter. Engineering says the product is superior. Sales says the demos went great. So why are inferior competitors winning? Get your free competitive intelligence report and find out exactly where you're losing ground — and how to fix it.

#### Headline (below image)

**See exactly why you're losing robotics deals you should win** *(60 chars)*

#### Visual Direction for Designer

**Concept:** Bold question fills the entire frame against a dark purple gradient background. The question mark is oversized and slightly lighter purple, creating visual hierarchy without competing for attention.

**Style:** Dark purple (\#2D1B69) to lighter purple gradient background. White text for the question, clean sans-serif font. Question mark 150% larger than the text. Subtle grid pattern in background for tech feel. Small Ideometry logo in bottom corner.

**Reference:** Think of those provocative LinkedIn thought leadership ads where a single question fills the entire frame, but with a technical purple aesthetic instead of corporate blue

#### Strategic Rationale

*VPs of Marketing feel personally responsible for lost deals and desperately want to understand the 'why' — this taps into that immediate pain while promising specific intelligence, not generic advice.*

---

### **Variation 2: Wasted budget on wrong channels — the strategic misalignment pain point**

**Target Role:** CMO/Head of Marketing at robotics companies

#### Post Text (above image)

You're spending $50K/month on marketing channels that work great for SaaS — but your robotics sales cycle is 18 months with 7 stakeholders. No wonder pipeline is dry. Stop copying B2B playbooks that weren't built for robotics. Get your personalized channel analysis in 5 minutes.

#### Headline (below image)

**Your marketing budget is optimized for SaaS, not robotics** *(58 chars)*

#### Visual Direction for Designer

**Concept:** Editorial photo of a modern robotics facility or warehouse with automated systems, overlaid with a semi-transparent dark purple panel on the left third where the text sits. The photo shows the reality of their complex world.

**Style:** High-quality photo of actual robotics/automation in a warehouse or manufacturing setting. Dark purple (\#2D1B69) overlay panel with 80% opacity on left side. White text on the overlay. Purple glow effect on one robot or system in the photo. Clean, premium feel.

**Reference:** Similar to IBM's industry photography campaigns — real environments with minimal text overlay, showing the actual world the audience operates in rather than generic office settings

#### Strategic Rationale

*CMOs know they're wasting money but need justification to change course — positioning this as a robotics-specific problem (not their fault) with a quick diagnostic makes it irresistible.*

---

### **Variation 3: Technical excellence doesn't translate to market success — the founder's frustration**

**Target Role:** Founder/CEO of robotics companies

#### Post Text (above image)

Your engineering team built category-defining robotics tech. Your website reads like a spec sheet. Buyers can't tell if you do warehouse automation or build robot vacuums. Meanwhile, competitors with worse tech are closing deals because they speak human. Time to fix your positioning.

| **CTA** | Get Free Analysis → |

#### Headline (below image)

**Engineering-led robotics companies: great tech, unclear story** *(62 chars)*

#### Visual Direction for Designer

**Concept:** Checklist card design showing what robotics companies typically have (great tech) versus what they're missing (positioning, messaging). Green checkmarks for strengths, red X's for gaps, creating immediate visual assessment.

**Style:** Clean white background with subtle purple gradient at edges. Bold purple (\#2D1B69) headline. Green checkmarks and red X marks in circles. Each item in clean sans-serif. Purple CTA button at bottom. Subtle drop shadow on the card.

**Reference:** Like a marketing maturity scorecard or audit checklist — instant visual scanning shows where they're strong (tech) and where they need help (go-to-market)

#### Strategic Rationale

*Technical founders know their product is better but struggle to articulate why in market terms — this validates their product quality while identifying the real gap: positioning and messaging.*

#### Headline (below image)

**Stop losing enterprise robotics deals you should have won** *(57 chars)*

#### Visual Direction for Designer

**Concept:** bold-typography

**Style:** Dark purple background with the statistic '90%' taking up 40% of the frame in bold white typography. Supporting text in lighter purple. Subtle grid pattern in background.

**Reference:** Think Apple's percentage-based campaign ads but with Ideometry's dark purple tech aesthetic — the number dominates the frame and makes you stop scrolling

#### Strategic Rationale

*VPs of Marketing feel the pain of lost deals most acutely and need to explain to leadership why superior tech didn't win. The 90% stat reframes the problem as solvable through better positioning.*

### **Variation 2: Wasted budget with specific dollar amount**

**Target Role:** CMO

#### Post Text (above image)

Most robotics companies waste $250K+ annually on marketing channels built for SaaS, not 18-month enterprise deals. Our free Demand Gen Channel Analyzer scores 8 marketing channels specifically for your robotics sales motion. See which channels actually generate pipeline for companies selling $500K+ robotics solutions. Takes 5 minutes.

#### Headline (below image)

**LinkedIn works for robotics. Google Ads doesn't. Know why?** *(60 chars)*

#### Visual Direction for Designer

**Concept:** icon-grid

**Style:** Dark background with 6 marketing channel icons in a 2x3 grid. Three icons glow purple (winners), three are grayed out with red X marks (losers). Clean, scannable layout.

**Reference:** Similar to HubSpot's channel performance grids but with a stark winner/loser visual treatment — immediately shows which channels work for robotics vs generic B2B

#### Strategic Rationale

*CMOs are directly accountable for marketing ROI and the $250K figure represents real budget at risk. The channel-specific angle promises tactical insights they can act on immediately.*

| **Supporting Text** | Fix your robotics messaging in 5 minutes |
| **CTA** | Get Intelligence Report → |

#### Headline (below image)

**Your robotics tech is better. Their story wins the deal.** *(58 chars)*

#### Visual Direction for Designer

**Concept:** minimal-dark

**Style:** Near-black background. 'Weak positioning' in bold purple accent color. Other text in clean white. Single thin purple line connects the three phrases. Ideometry logo subtle in corner.

**Reference:** Tesla-style minimalism but for B2B — the stark simplicity of the design reinforces the clarity of thinking that robotics companies need in their messaging

#### Strategic Rationale

*Founders of engineering-led companies feel this truth viscerally — they know their tech is superior but watch inferior products win deals through better storytelling.*

**Know exactly why you're losing deals to weaker competitors** *(58 chars)*

#### Visual Direction for Designer

**Concept:** bold-typography

**Style:** White text on deep purple background. The question fills 70% of the frame in bold sans-serif. 'inferior robot' in bright purple accent. Small Ideometry logo bottom corner.

**Reference:** Think Apple's minimalist billboards but with a tech-forward purple palette. The question should feel like it's being asked directly to the viewer in a boardroom.

#### Strategic Rationale

### **Variation 2: Budget waste from using generic B2B tactics on robotics sales**

**Target Role:** CMO

#### Post Text (above image)

Still betting your $500K marketing budget on channels built for SaaS companies? Robotics enterprise deals don't close like software. Your 18-month sales cycle needs different tactics.

#### Headline (below image)

**Stop wasting budget on channels that don't fit robotics** *(57 chars)*

#### Visual Direction for Designer

**Concept:** bold-question

**Style:** Dark purple gradient background. The question fills 80% of frame in white, with '18-month' in bright purple. Large question mark integrated into design. Clean, tech-forward aesthetic.

**Reference:** Like LinkedIn's own thought leadership ads where the question is the entire visual. The emptiness around the text creates urgency and focus.

#### Strategic Rationale

*CMOs feel pressure to justify every marketing dollar. The specific mention of 18-month deals and $500K budgets shows we understand their exact situation, not generic B2B.*

### **Variation 3: Competitive paranoia and urgency around positioning**

**Target Role:** Founder/CEO

#### Visual Direction for Designer

**Concept:** minimal-dark

**Style:** Near-black background with bright purple accent on 'YOUR'. White text, ultra-clean layout. Subtle grid pattern in background suggesting technical precision. Ideometry logo small, bottom-left.

**Reference:** Tesla's dark minimal ads but with a cyberpunk purple accent. The restraint signals confidence — like a premium tech company that doesn't need to shout.

#### Strategic Rationale

*Founders feel personal responsibility for competitive losses. The question taps into their fear of being outmaneuvered while they're focused on product development instead of positioning.*

#### Headline (below image)

**Still using SaaS marketing tactics for 18-month robotics deals?** *(65 chars)*

#### Visual Direction for Designer

**Concept:** A before/after vertical stack showing cluttered generic marketing tactics on top (crossed out, faded) versus clean robotics-specific strategies below (highlighted in purple glow)

**Style:** Top half: grayscale with red X marks over generic terms like 'webinars', 'whitepapers'. Bottom half: dark purple background with specific robotics tactics glowing in bright purple. Clean, technical font throughout.

**Reference:** Think of a code diff view but for marketing strategies — red strikethrough lines being replaced by green (purple in our case) improvements below

#### Strategic Rationale

*VPs of Marketing in robotics know generic advice doesn't work but need validation they're not alone. The 73% stat creates urgency while the vertical stack visually reinforces the transformation.*

---

### **Variation 2: Quantifies wasted spend on wrong channels versus targeted robotics approach**

**Target Role:** CMO

#### Post Text (above image)

Most robotics marketing agencies: 'Try more content marketing\!' Reality: Your warehouse automation buyers don't read blogs — they evaluate POCs over 12-18 months. Stop wasting $15K/month on channels built for SaaS. Get your free demand gen channel analysis. See which 3 channels actually drive enterprise robotics deals.

*326 characters*

#### On the Image

| **Supporting Text** | vs. $15K driving real robotics pipeline |
| **CTA** | Analyze My Channels → |

#### Headline (below image)

**That marketing budget could've funded 3 trade show booths** *(58 chars)*

#### Visual Direction for Designer

**Concept:** Single metric spotlight showing '$180K' in large, faded red text taking up 40% of the image, with smaller '$15K' in bright purple below it with an upward arrow

**Style:** Dark background with the wasted budget number in muted red, almost ghostly. The effective spend in vibrant purple with subtle glow effect. Include small icons of wasted channels (blog, social) fading away.

**Reference:** Think of a financial dashboard alert — the big scary number you're losing versus the small smart number that actually works

#### Strategic Rationale

*CMOs feel the pain of wasted budget viscerally. The $180K number is 12 months at $15K — realistic for their spend level. Trade show reference resonates with robotics buying behavior.*

### **Variation 3: Addresses the founder's frustration of having superior tech but losing to inferior competitors**

**Target Role:** Founder/CEO

#### Post Text (above image)

Your engineering team built a superior cobot. Your competitors close deals faster. The difference? They know which 3 messages resonate with automation VPs.

#### Headline (below image)

**Why inferior robots win enterprise accounts** *(44 chars)*

#### Visual Direction for Designer

**Concept:** Minimal dark design with 'Better product.' in white and 'Losing deals.' in stark red, creating immediate emotional contrast through typography alone

**Style:** Near-black background. 'Better product' in clean white sans-serif. Period in purple. 'Losing deals' in the same font but deep red. Extreme minimalism — let the painful truth speak.

**Reference:** Think of those minimal Apple billboards but highlighting a painful business truth instead of a product benefit

#### Strategic Rationale

*Founders take lost deals personally, especially when they know their product is better. The minimal design mirrors their no-BS preference while the message validates their suspicion that it's about positioning, not product.*

- Robotics companies are using this to win deals  
- Following up — free competitive analysis

**Body:**

Hi {{firstName}},

As a leader in the robotics industry, it’s important to have intel on competitors. 

Things move fast in the industry.

This is why we built a competitive intelligence report specifically for innovative robotics companies. 

A few robotics companies have used it recently to:

- Identify messaging gaps they didn't know existed  
- Find competitor weaknesses to exploit in sales conversations  
- Rebuild their homepage positioning based on the analysis

The whole thing takes 5 minutes and it's free — we built it as a resource for the robotics marketing community.

### **Email 3: Pivot to Demand Gen Analyzer**

**Subject Lines (test):**

- Which marketing channels actually work for {{company}}?  
- Stop guessing on channel strategy  
- A different resource for {{company}}

**Body:**

Hi {{firstName}},

It’s hard for innovative robotics companies to reach the right audience. Especially with a new product.

Should you focus on trade shows, LinkedIn ads, outbound, or SEO? 

Generic marketing advice doesn't cut it when you're selling complex robotics solutions with 6-12 month sales cycles to enterprise buyers.

We built a free Demand Gen Channel Analyzer that scores 8 marketing channels based on YOUR specific situation:

- Your deal size and sales cycle  
- Your buyer type and vertical  
- Your actual budget

It also builds a 90-day activation roadmap so you're not just getting analysis — you're getting a plan.

Can I send over the link for you to give it a try?

Best, {{senderName}}

### **Email 4: Value-Add Follow-up**

**Subject Lines (test):**

- Re: Channel strategy for {{company}}  
- One more resource, then I'll stop  
- The "which channels" question

**Body:**

Hi {{firstName}},

You're selling your robotics solution into \[logistics/manufacturing/healthcare\] with what I assume is a complex, consultative sale. 

That means:

- Trade shows might make sense, but only at the right budget level  
- Content/SEO is a 6-12 month play, not a quick win  
- LinkedIn ads work, but the math changes based on your deal size

We are a marketing agency that works with robotics companies…all day, every day. 

And based on years of running campaigns, we built a tool that analyzes which channels are the best fit for your robotics company. No guessing.

**→ Free report, absolutely no sales call required:** [https://tools.ideometry.com/demand-gen-analyzer](https://tools.ideometry.com/demand-gen-analyzer)

Let me know what you think\!
