* Founder/CEO who needs to understand marketing investment ROI

## **Why These Lead Magnets?**

### **Strategic Rationale**

| Factor | Competitive Intelligence | Demand Gen Analyzer |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Funnel Stage** | Problem-aware (know they have competitors, unsure how they compare) | Solution-aware (know they need demand gen, unsure which channels) |
| **Emotion** | Curiosity \+ anxiety (FOMO about competitor moves) | Frustration \+ hope (tired of wasting budget) |
| **Sales Conversation** | "Let's talk about how to act on these insights" | "Let's build the program we just scoped" |
| **Qualification Signal** | Has competitors \= real market \= viable prospect | Has budget \= ready to invest \= viable prospect |

### 

### **Why Not Gated PDFs or Webinars?**

1. **Interactive tools create higher engagement** — Users invest time answering questions, increasing commitment  
2. **Personalized output is more valuable** — Generic content is everywhere; custom analysis is rare  
3. **Demonstrates capability** — The tool IS the proof that Ideometry understands their world  
4. **Better lead quality** — Someone who completes a 5-minute tool is more qualified than a PDF download  
5. **Conversation starter** — "I saw your report — let's discuss" is an easy sales hook

### **Strategic Angle**

**Pain Point:** "We're losing deals and don't understand why"

**Tool:** Demand Gen Channel Analyzer   
**URL:** [https://tools.ideometry.com/demand-gen-analyzer](https://tools.ideometry.com/demand-gen-analyzer)

### **Strategic Angle**

**Pain Point:** "We're not sure where to spend our marketing budget"   
**Emotion:** Validation of frustration, then relief — "Finally, someone who can tell me where my budget should actually go"   
**Scroll-Stopper:** Bold, slightly negative framing — calling out that most budget is wasted validates what they secretly fear

### **Visual Creative**

**Composition:** Budget allocation visualization showing money flow. Left side shows scattered, chaotic distribution. Right side shows organized, strategic allocation.

### **Visual Creative**

**Composition:** Interactive tool preview/dashboard aesthetic showing channel scorecards with viability scores.

- Your competitors have already researched {{company}}  
- Quick question about {{company}}'s competitive positioning

**Body:**

Hi {{firstName}},

I’m impressed with what you’ve built at {{company}}. 

Quick question: Do you know how your positioning compares to your biggest competitors in the robotics space?

We built a free tool specifically for robotics companies that analyzes your website against your competitors and identifies:

- Positioning gaps costing you deals  
- Content and proof point differences  
- Specific vulnerabilities you can exploit in sales conversations

Takes 2 minutes to set up. Report delivered in 5\.

Want to give it a try? Let me know and I’ll send over the link.

Best,   
{{senderName}}

P.S. We work exclusively with robotics companies, so the benchmarks are actually relevant to your market.

### **Email 2: Follow-up \+ Social Proof**

**Subject Lines (test):**

- Re: Competitive positioning for {{company}}  
- Robotics companies are using this to win deals  
- Following up — free competitive analysis

**Body:**

Hi {{firstName}},

As a leader in the robotics industry, it’s important to have intel on competitors. 

Things move fast in the industry.

This is why we built a competitive intelligence report specifically for innovative robotics companies. 

A few robotics companies have used it recently to:

- Identify messaging gaps they didn't know existed  
- Find competitor weaknesses to exploit in sales conversations  
- Rebuild their homepage positioning based on the analysis

The whole thing takes 5 minutes and it's free — we built it as a resource for the robotics marketing community.

### **Email 3: Pivot to Demand Gen Analyzer**

**Subject Lines (test):**

- Which marketing channels actually work for {{company}}?  
- Stop guessing on channel strategy  
- A different resource for {{company}}

**Body:**

Hi {{firstName}},

It’s hard for innovative robotics companies to reach the right audience. Especially with a new product.

Should you focus on trade shows, LinkedIn ads, outbound, or SEO? 

Generic marketing advice doesn't cut it when you're selling complex robotics solutions with 6-12 month sales cycles to enterprise buyers.

We built a free Demand Gen Channel Analyzer that scores 8 marketing channels based on YOUR specific situation:

- Your deal size and sales cycle  
- Your buyer type and vertical  
- Your actual budget

It also builds a 90-day activation roadmap so you're not just getting analysis — you're getting a plan.

Can I send over the link for you to give it a try?

Best, {{senderName}}

### **Email 4: Value-Add Follow-up**

**Subject Lines (test):**

- Re: Channel strategy for {{company}}  
- One more resource, then I'll stop  
- The "which channels" question

**Body:**

Hi {{firstName}},

You're selling your robotics solution into \[logistics/manufacturing/healthcare\] with what I assume is a complex, consultative sale. 

That means:

- Trade shows might make sense, but only at the right budget level  
- Content/SEO is a 6-12 month play, not a quick win  
- LinkedIn ads work, but the math changes based on your deal size

We are a marketing agency that works with robotics companies…all day, every day. 

And based on years of running campaigns, we built a tool that analyzes which channels are the best fit for your robotics company. No guessing.

**→ Free report, absolutely no sales call required:** [https://tools.ideometry.com/demand-gen-analyzer](https://tools.ideometry.com/demand-gen-analyzer)
