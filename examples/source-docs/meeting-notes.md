# Campaign Kickoff Meeting - Jan 15, 2026

Attendees: Sarah (Head of Marketing), Mike (Demand Gen), Lisa (Content)

## Key Decisions

- Running LinkedIn Sponsored Content + AdRoll display retargeting
- LinkedIn for cold audience, display for retargeting website visitors
- Budget: $50K/month, split 60/40 LinkedIn/display
- Primary goal: demo requests, secondary: content downloads

## Discussion Notes

Sarah: "Our biggest problem is the ads we've been running are too generic. Headlines like 'Secure Your Code' could be from any security company. We need to speak directly to the CISO persona — what keeps them up at night."

Mike: "The false positive angle resonates the most in conversations I have with prospects. Every AppSec team I talk to is drowning in noise from their current tools. That's our wedge."

Lisa: "We should also lean into the speed angle for the engineering-focused audience. VPs of Eng care less about security and more about not slowing down their team."

Sarah: "Good point — we may need different angles for security buyers vs engineering buyers. Security cares about risk reduction and compliance. Engineering cares about velocity and developer experience."

## Action Items
- Create separate ad sets for security leaders and engineering leaders
- Lead with false positives angle for security audience
- Lead with speed (90 seconds) for engineering audience
- Make sure we mention Stripe/Datadog as customers — name recognition matters
- Avoid: "best-in-class", "world-class", "revolutionary", "game-changing"
- Test at least 3-4 ad types per audience segment
