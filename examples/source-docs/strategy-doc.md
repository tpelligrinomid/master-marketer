# Acme Security - Q1 2026 Campaign Strategy

## Company Overview
Acme Security is a DevSecOps platform that integrates security scanning directly into CI/CD pipelines. Founded in 2022, Series B ($45M), based in San Francisco.

Our product scans code for vulnerabilities in under 90 seconds and uses AI-powered triage to eliminate false positives entirely. We integrate natively with GitHub, GitLab, Jenkins, and Azure DevOps.

## Key Metrics
- 400+ engineering teams as customers
- Reduces mean time to remediation by 73%
- SOC 2 Type II and ISO 27001 certified
- Notable customers: Stripe, Datadog, HashiCorp

## Q1 Campaign Goals
We want to drive demo requests from mid-market and enterprise security leaders. Our pipeline is thin at the director+ level and we need to fill it.

The primary offer is a 30-minute personalized demo where we scan the prospect's actual codebase live.

## Target Audience
We're going after CISOs, VPs of Security, Heads of Application Security, and Directors of Information Security at mid-market B2B companies (200-1000 employees) in FinTech, SaaS, and Healthcare IT.

These people are dealing with:
- Security scanning that slows down their engineering teams
- Drowning in false positives from legacy SAST tools like Snyk, Checkmarx, and Veracode
- Boards asking them to reduce risk without adding headcount
- Upcoming compliance deadlines (SOC 2 audits, HIPAA)
- New CISOs evaluating the existing security stack

## Competitive Positioning
We're faster than everyone (90 seconds vs 30+ minutes) and we have zero false positives which nobody else can claim. Our CI/CD integration takes 15 minutes to set up, compared to weeks for legacy tools.

## Brand Voice
Authoritative but not condescending. We talk to security leaders as peers. Specific, never vague. Short sentences. No buzzwords like "next-gen" or "cutting-edge" — those make us sound like everyone else.

Must always mention: 90 seconds, zero false positives.
